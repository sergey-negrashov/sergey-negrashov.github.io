*This page presents my statement of purpose in computer science as required for the [ICS Ph.D. Portfolio](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/ph-d-in-ics/#phd-portfolio). It summarizes my professional interests in research, teaching, service, and/or product development.*

Sensor networks are taking on a new face in an advent of the Internet of Things. Topologies which relied on mesh networked radios are being quickly replaced with end-to-end TCP/IP based devices. This trend will accelerate as semiconductor companies introduce ever more integrated WIFI chip-sets, which combine analog and digital radio circuitry with an embedded CPU core in a single package. These devices are able to run for months or even years on batteries, and are quickly displacing traditional low power radio chip-sets.  Furthermore, cheap Linux single board computers are filling the gap for IOT applications which require significant DSP resources. The leap in technology that powered IOT is now making its way into traditional sensor networks and distributed measurements. 

The literature reveals many projects on IP based distributed measurement networks [7][6][8]. With the recent move towards cloud computing, sensor network acquisition has evolved into scalable cloud based systems. The architecture for such systems is well described and understood.[1] However, hardly any systems using this architecture operates in environments where a single instrument signal-to-noise ratio is below 1. In such topologies, data across several sensor nodes is required to make a decision on the global event. While traditional sensor networks would resort to techniques such as self-organization and voting to localize events of interest[2], IP based networks simply acquire all of the high resolution data that the measurement devices record. Indeed IP sensor nodes do not have the luxury of communication with their peers without an intermediary due to firewalls and security constraints. If the event rate is low, compared to the sampling rate of the sensor node, the ratio of the event data to the acquired and transmitted data will be high.

Some analysts predict that by year 2020 200 Billion devices will be connected to the internet.[6] The real-time stream of data from these devices, will contain a wealth of timing critical information, that could be used to solve optimization problems from renewable generation, to traffic management[8]. All of these devices, however will compete for the same bandwidth, and computational resources. Selecting useful data from the noise generated by 200 billion internet enabled devices is an enormous technical challenge. Overcoming this challenge will take require application of novel methods in real-time data filtering and analysis, on a never-before seen scale.

For my Ph.D. thesis I will explore novel methods of data reduction, via intelligent triggering in low signal-to-noise IP-based sensor networks. A triggering front-end will be placed in front of the traditional acquisition system as described in [1] and constantly acquire feature extracted data sent from the sensor nodes. If the feature extracted triggering stream shows an anomaly across multiple devices, a high resolution event data can be requested from the device nodes. I intend to show that such a system will outperform traditional acquisition paradigms by optimizing two metrics:

1. Minimized bandwidth factor (ratio of the event data to the acquired and transmitted data.)
2. Maximized trigger efficiency (ratio of recorded events to the total events)

In addition to performance, there are other benefits to an intelligent triggering system. Privacy is becoming a major issue in sensor networks, as they are commonly deployed into residential environments and workplaces.[3][4] Continuous acquisition in such networks may record events which originate from local disturbances, and may in-turn leak sensitive information. My smart triggering front-end would simply discard such events, since they would only appear in a single sensor node triggering stream.

In order to validate my approach I will use the Open Power Quality(OPQ) sensor network as a testbed. OPQ is a distributed power quality monitoring network currently under development. It is composed of the in-house designed sensor nodes(OPQBox), and a two tiered data acquisition system. The first tier called Makai receives a feature reduced data from OPQBoxes. If Makai observes a disturbance in the feature reduced data stream, it will request high resolution data from the community of OPQBoxes for that time period. A window of waveforms which contain the disturbance are then forwarded to the Mauka tier. Mauka will validate, analyze and classify the PQ event and store it for further retrieval.

This work is inspired in part by the High Energy Physics data acquisition systems[5]. Such systems consist of thousands of data channels each sampling in excess of 2Gsps. A traditional approach using flash ADCs would be unfeasible, due to cost and power requirements. Instead signal is sampled in analog form and stored in a capacitive storage array of 1us depth. A separate low resolution system in turn looks for events and decides which portions of analog storage array to digitize and store. Such systems provide a huge data/cost/power reductions, while maintaining high trigger efficiency. I hope that extending these ideas to IP based sensor networks will lead to similar results.
