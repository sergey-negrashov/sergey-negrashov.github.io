*This page presents evidence of my scholarly ability in computer science as required for the [ICS Ph.D. Portfolio](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/ph-d-in-ics/#phd-portfolio). This includes evidence of ability to identify, critically analyze, and research a problem, as well as written communication skills.*

## Literature Review:
My literature review focuses on uses of compression and
compressed sensing in bandwidth constrained sensor networks.

### OpenPowerQuality: An Open Source Framework for Power Quality Collection, Analysis, Visualization, and Privacy.

**Abstract**

As power grids transition from a centralized distri-
bution model to a distributed model, maintaining grid stability re-
quires real-time power quality (PQ) monitoring and visualization.
As part of the Open Power Quality (OPQ) project, we designed
and deployed a set of open source power quality monitors and
an open source cloud-based aggregation and visualization system
built with the utility customer in mind. Our aim is to leverage
a flexible privacy model combined with inexpensive and easy to
use PQ meters in order to deploy a high density power quality
monitoring network across the Hawaiian islands. In this paper we
describe OPHub, a privacy focused open source PQ visualization
along with results of a small scale deployment of our prototype
PQ meter across the island of Oahu. Our results demonstrate
that OPQ can provide useful power quality data at an order of
magnitude less cost than prior approaches.

**Abstract**

We present the development of the miniTimeCube (mTC), a novel compact
neutrino detector. The mTC is a multipurpose detector, aiming to detect
not only neutrinos but also fast/thermal neutrons. Potential applications
include the counterproliferation of nuclear materials and the investigation
of antineutrino short-baseline effects. The mTC is a plastic 0.2% 10B - 
doped scintillator (13 cm)3 cube surrounded by 24 Micro-Channel Plate (MCP)
photon detectors, each with an 8Ã—8 anode totaling 1536 individual channels
/pixels viewing the scintillator. It uses custom-made electronics modules 
which mount on top of the MCPs, making our detector compact and able to 
both distinguish different types of events and reject noise in real time.
The detector is currently deployed and being tested at the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research
(NCNR) nuclear reactor (20 MWth) in Gaithersburg, MD. A shield for 
further tests is being constructed, and calibration and upgrades are 
ongoing. The mTC's improved spatiotemporal resolution will allow for 
determination of incident particle directions beyond previous capabilities.
