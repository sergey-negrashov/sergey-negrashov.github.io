This embodies my lifelong passion with cars and motorcycles. I have worked on just about anything from small 30cc two strokes from the 50s to high revving motorcycle engines of the 21st century. The machine I put the most effort into by far is the 1981 KZ1000 motorcycle. Its multi-year project with 100s of man hours; purely a labor of love that I am not sure I will ever finish. With custom machining in just about every part of the bike, custom electronics and cotrols, its a dream to ride in those rare moments, I dont have it torn down.
