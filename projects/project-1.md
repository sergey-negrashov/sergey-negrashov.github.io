Open Power Quality was an academic project and an associated startup company aimed at studying power quality across the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaii is a perfect place to study emergent phenomena originating from the high concentration of renewable energy sources. With the highest penetration of solar in the country, along with aggressive legislative mandates to the move Hawaiian islands to renewable energy, the pressure is on to come up with a strategy of transitioning the state of Hawaii into a greener future. Open Power Quality project aimed at monitoring the power grid of the Island of Hawaii. We utilized in-house designed power quality meters along with custom cloud based software to capture anomalies in the power distribution system.

In this project I was responsible for development of power quality sensors, writing the embedded software end firmware, managing the cloud-sensor communication as well as cloud based anomaly detection.
