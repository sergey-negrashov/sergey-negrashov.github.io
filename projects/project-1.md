Open power quality project is a vertically integrated power quality monitoring ecosystem comprised of in-house designed power quality meters, aggregation software, analytics and visualization. Our aim is to enable utility users to monitor quality of electrical and pinpoint the origin of the power quality disturbances while preserving their privacy.Our metering equipment, data acquisition software, and analysis stack are in-house designed, which allows us to tailor it to any PQ measurement. The goal is to have a system flexible enough to perform small scale analysis, such as PQ site surveys, while maintaining scalability to deploy a state wide PQ monitoring system.  

For this project I am responsible for the design of the power quality meters from simulation PCB design to development of software. Furthermore I am responsible for the initial event identification as well as soft real-time analysis of the grid status. Finally I am in charge of undergraduate outreach and recruiting for the OPQ project.
